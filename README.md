# Always Continue Chrome Extension

![Always Continue Logo](src/icon128.png)

Always Continue is a Chrome extension that automatically clicks the "Continue" button in ChatGPT conversations, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted experience while ChatGPT does its thing—letting you focus on the conversation (and maybe enjoy that snack). Plus, it’ll automatically dismiss the "you’ve reached your limit, upgrade to Plus" warning.

**Note**: This is an experimental extension. It may cause issues when ChatGPT updates its UI, so use it at your own risk. The extension isn’t available on the Chrome Web Store yet, but you can install it manually by following the instructions below. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/oliveirabruno01/always-continue-ChatGPT/issues).
